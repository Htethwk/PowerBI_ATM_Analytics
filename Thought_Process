1. Understanding the Objective
The primary objective was to create a set of dashboards to provide actionable insights into ATM transactions, errors, reversal rates, cash requirements, and replenishment trips. These insights would help stakeholders optimize ATM operations, improve cash availability, reduce transaction reversals, and enhance overall efficiency.

Key considerations included:
- Identifying ATMs with high reversal rates.
- Understanding transaction errors and their causes.
- Forecasting cash requirements and replenishment trips for ATM operation Team to ensure uninterrupted service for      custmers since Myanmar(Burma) relies on cash for any financial transactions.
- Providing detailed insights into payroll-related ATM interactions.

2. Data Collection and Preparation
Steps Taken:
- Data Sources Identified: Transaction logs, ATM details, replenishment records, and payroll data were collected from various systems.
- Data Cleaning:
  - Removed duplicate records and irrelevant columns.
  - Standardize date and time formats to ensure consistency across all tables in Power Query, as most systems produce dates in the (dd/mm/yyyy) format, which Power Query does not recognize.
  - Addressed missing values by using imputation techniques or removing incomplete records where necessary.
- Data Relationships:
  - Established relationships between tables, such as ATM transaction table, ATM information table, Replenished Data table, Moblie Car ATM records,Agent information table, Payroll information and Payroll ATM service request table.
  - Ensured the data model was optimized for quick queries and accurate calculations.
  - Develop necessary DAX formulas and quick measures in Power BI to calculate error percentages, reversal rate and create accurate linear regression forecasts.

3. Dashboard Design and Creation
Approach:
- Identified Key Metrics:
  - Transaction volume, reversal rates, error types, cash withdrawal amounts, replenishment counts, etc.
- Visualization Choices:
  - Bar Charts: For comparison metrics such as transactions by ATM or error types.
  - Line Charts: To analyze trends over time, such as daily withdrawal volumes or replenishment patterns.
  - Tables: For detailed analysis replenishment forecast, such as error percentages or transaction breakdowns by terminal.
  - KPIs: Used for quick snapshots of critical metrics like total transaction count, reversal percentage, and error   totals.
- Interactivity:Added slicers for filtering by month, terminal, or location type to make the dashboard dynamic and user-friendly.

Dashboards Created:
1. Reversal Rate Analysis: Highlighted ATMs with 1% and above reversal percentages and visualized diffrent reversal categories for better insights
2. Error Analysis: Displayed error counts and percentages, categorized by error type and terminal.
3. Payroll Interactions: Focused on payroll company-related ATM transactions, service tickets and payroll portfolio.
4. Transaction Overview: Provided a high-level summary of transactions, withdrawals, and replenishments.
5. Forecasting Dashboards: Showcased cash requirements and replenishment trips using linear regression predictive models.

4. Advanced Features: Cash Requirement and Replenishment Trip Forecasting
To improve operational efficiency, I incorporated predictive analytics into the dashboard:

- Cash Requirement Forecasting:
  - Used linear regression to predict daily cash requirements based on historical withdrawal data.
  - Considered variables such as transaction trends, location type, and historical cash usage patterns.
  - Visualized the predicted cash demand over time to aid in planning.

- Replenishment Trip Forecasting:
  - Calculated the number of replenishment trips required by dividing the predicted cash demand by the ATM's cash capacity, ensuring proactive trip planning.

5. Challenges Faced
- Data Quality Issues:
  - Inconsistent data formats and missing values required significant preprocessing.
- Complex Relationships:
  - Establishing accurate relationships between multiple data tables without creating circular dependencies was challenging.
- Forecasting Accuracy:
  - Fine-tuning the regression models to improve the accuracy of cash and trip forecast over and oaver again.
- **Visualization Optimization:**
  - Balancing detail and simplicity to ensure the dashboards remained user-friendly while conveying essential insights.

6. Insights Gained
- ATMs with the highest reversal rates were identified, enabling targeted improvements.
- Common transaction errors, such as "insufficient funds" and "issuer limit exceeded," were highlighted for resolution.
- Forecasting dashboards provided actionable insights for cash replenishment planning and operational efficiency.
- Identified under-served payroll companies needing more ATMs, monitored cash flow efficiency by comparing disbursements to withdrawals, and prioritized replenishment trips based on payroll ATM usage

7. Future Improvements
- Real-Time Data Integration: Automate data refresh to provide up-to-date insights.
- Machine Learning Models: Enhance forecasting with more advanced machine learning techniques.
- Geospatial Analysis: Incorporate maps to visualize ATM locations and performance.
- User Feedback: Gather feedback from stakeholders to refine the dashboards further.
